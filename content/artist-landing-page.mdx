## Drums for Sale
![Drums for sale](/images/buy-drums.jpg)

Get your own Dagomba drum! The performers of Dagomba music are lunsi, members of a hereditary clan of 
drummers. Lunsi fulfill many vital duties in the life of the Dagomba - genealogist, 
counselor to royalty, cultural expert, etc. There are two main drums played by the 
Lunsi: the Lunga (talking drum) and the Gungon (bass drum).

![Nico drums for sale Lunga](/images/sale-tak.jpg)
The lunga is a double-headed hourglass shaped tension drum carved from the Shea 
Butter tree. By squeezing and pulling on the leather cords, the player can change the 
tension and thus the pitch of the drum. Pitches can vary over an octave and many 
intervals can be attained. 

In the hands of an expert, the drum becomes a way of 
communicating Dagbani, the spoken language of the Dagomba people. Many styles of 
Ghanaian music are based upon speech, therefore the bond between language and 
music are so intimate that it is actually possible to tune and play an instrument so that 
the music it produces is linguistically comprehensible. These drums come in two sizes, medium and large. 

![Nico drums for sale gungon](/images/sale-dag.jpg)
The Gungon is a medium sized cylindrical bass drum used to accompany the Lunga. It is 
a double headed drum with snares on each head. It produces a rich bass tone when 
struck in the middle and has a wide array of overtones and buzz when played above the 
snares. These also come in medium and large sizes. 

All the shells are carved in Tamale, Northern Ghana. The drums are made by Sulley 
Imoro, and expert and exponent of Dagomba music, dance, and culture. These drums are 
the highest of quality and satisfaction is guaranteed.
